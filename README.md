👋 About Me

I’m Rabiah, an aspiring Cybersecurity Specialist. Currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in Cybersecurity at Asia Pacific University (APU) after completing my Foundation Programme (Computing & Technology Route). I’m passionate about building secure, efficient systems — and ethically breaking them to understand how to defend them.
